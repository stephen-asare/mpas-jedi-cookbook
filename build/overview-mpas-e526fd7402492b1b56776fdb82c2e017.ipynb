    "The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) is a collaborative project for developing atmosphere, ocean and other earth-system simulation components for use in climate, regional climate and weather studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The defining features of MPAS are the unstructured [Voronoi meshes](https://public.lanl.gov/ringler/Voronoi.html) and [C-grid](https://mpas-dev.github.io/files/graphics/cgrid.pdf) discretization used as the basis for many of the model components. The unstructured Voronoi meshes, formally Spherical Centriodal Voronoi Tesselations (SCVTs), allow for both quasi-uniform discretization of the sphere and local refinement. The C-grid discretization, where the normal component of velocity on cell edges is prognosed, is especially well-suited for higher-resolution, mesoscale atmosphere and ocean simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The land ice model takes advantage of the SCVT-dual mesh, which is a triangular Delaunay tessellation appropriate for use with Finite-Element-based discretizations.\n",
