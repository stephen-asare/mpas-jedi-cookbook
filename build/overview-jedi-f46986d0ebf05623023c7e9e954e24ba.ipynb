    "Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) is a unified and versatile data assimilation (DA) system for Earth System Prediction. The JEDI software package can be run on a variety of platforms from laptops to supercomputers, for a variety of purposes, from teaching and learning DA fundamentals to the development and validation of new DA algorithms and observational operators, to leading-edge atmospheric and oceanic research, to operational weather forecasting. It is designed to readily accommodate new atmospheric and oceanic models and new observation systems."
